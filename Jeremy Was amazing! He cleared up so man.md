Jeremy Was amazing! He cleared up so many questions That I had about built in functions and especially the weird logic of the sort method For numbers. One aspect of the class that I loved Is that he was using a tool called replit.https://replit.com/@thecatfix/builtInFunctions?v=1
I was able to upload the materials to repl and easily follow along with what he was doing. 
Great Learning should start using Replet instead of VS Code. Another idea would be to use 
GitHub Code Spaces.
The amount of time it takes to set up an environment on VS Code that mimics what the instructor is using can be mind-numbing. I highly suggest that you include Jeremy in more sessions. He provided real-world applications to what we were learning.
